__XNA 4.0 Content Compiler__ Compile to .xnb your texture files, audio files and SpriteFont files without adding to the Content project. 
Very Usefull in tools to create content for a game.

Compile (All supported by XNA):

Image Files: *.bmp, *.jpg, *.png, *.tga, *.dds  
Audio Files: *.wav, *.mp3, *.wma  
SpriteFont Files: *.spritefont  

With the source Code, just add more file types(Like .X or .fbx) and compile it !!

My Improvements:
------
* Build content files one by one.
* `Compress Content` option.
